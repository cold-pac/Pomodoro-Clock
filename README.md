<h1>Pomodoro Clock</h1>
<ul>
	<li>This is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Timer</a>, created with React (and create-react-app)</li>
	<li>It uses Tone.js as a dependency, to create the timer finishing beep (currently the Mr Robot theme) </li>
	<li>The font and colour scheme were inspired by the Commodore 64 terminal, and taken from: https://codepen.io/dlouise</li>
